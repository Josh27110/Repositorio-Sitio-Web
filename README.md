This project is the e-commerce website, the main objective was to develop a functioning website that had a catalog of different products in store, that was sorted
out by a broad array of markers such as type, food, clothing, technology, perfumes, etc. We as an administrator could see all transactions that occurred with our client's purchases
and the client validate the purchase he/she just made, at the checkout part they would receive a PDF receipt containing purchase information and they can view in their profile the same info
just in case the store didn't send out said purchase they could use it to ask for a refund.

We added responsiveness so our website could be adequately displayed on any device and we learned how to use some tools to generate PDF on a website.
